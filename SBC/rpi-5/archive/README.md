RadioBerry V2.0 - Ham radio cape for Raspberry PI
=================================================


New development is focussing on the rpi-5.


I do only support the pio mode.

The gpio mode is not longer supported. To many versions and maintenance.

I want to focus on my own (new) experiments.


To keep a version i placed it in an archive folder; so if someone likes to support the gpio @rpi-5 version feel free!
